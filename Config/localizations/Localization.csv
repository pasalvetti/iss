Parts/Subtitle/iss_pma1,Text,,Pressurized Mating Adapter
Parts/Manufacturer/iss_pma1,Text,,Boeing – Huntington Beach
Parts/Description/iss_pma1,Text,,"PMA-1 is basically the space equivalent of a USB adapter, but instead of letting you connect your phone to a laptop, it lets spacecraft connect to the station. Think of it as the ultimate 'space plug-in' for cosmic commuters. Launched with the Unity module in 1998 aboard STS-88."

Parts/Manufacturer/iss_zvezda_solar_panel,Text,,RKK Energiya
Parts/Description/iss_zvezda_solar_panel,Text,,"Meet the solar panel that's seen more sunrises than a rooster. This retractable array is more interested in reminiscing about the glory days than tracking the sun. It's like a retired kerbonaut who's content to bask in the sunlight, occasionally muttering something about 'good old Comrade Sol'."

Parts/Manufacturer/iss_p6_truss,Text,,Boeing
Parts/Description/iss_p6_truss,Text,,"The P6 truss was the second truss segment to be added (after the Z1 truss) because it contains a large Solar Array Wing (SAW) that generated essential electricity for the station. It was delivered by Space Shuttle Endeavour during STS-97. It was the last human spaceflight of the 20th century."

Missions/Secondary/ISS01/Name,Text,,"ISS Mission 1: Zarya"
Missions/Secondary/ISS01/Description,Text,,"We embark on a truly historic endeavor, a mission that will mark the beginning of a new era in Kerbal space exploration. We are about to lay the foundation for the International Space Station, or ISS. When complete, it will be the largest space station ever constructed and will serve as a permanent research platform in low Kerbin orbit, a place where scientists from around the world can conduct experiments in microgravity and study the harsh environment of space.

Today, we begin construction with the launch of its inaugural component: Zarya. Meaning “Dawn”, Zarya will serve as the ISS’s primary source of power, propulsion, and guidance.

This is a momentous occasion, Director. We are not just launching a module; we are launching a dream. A dream of a permanent Kerbal presence in space, a dream of international cooperation, a dream of a future where Kerbals can live and work among the stars."
Missions/Secondary/ISS01/Objective,Text,,"Place the Zarya module in orbit around Kerbin with an altitude between 180 km and 200 km and an inclination of 51°, with no crew."

Missions/Secondary/ISS01/Debrief01,Text,,"Zarya is in orbit! I was worried for a moment there. The rocket was making some interesting noises during ascent. Sounded like Jeb was trying to play the bagpipes inside the fuel tank."
Missions/Secondary/ISS01/Debrief02,Text,,"This is a momentous occasion, Director. We have taken the first step on a journey that will lead to the construction of a permanent Kerbal presence in low orbit. This is just the beginning. We have many more modules to launch, many more experiments to conduct, many more dreams to fulfill. But today, we celebrate this milestone."
Missions/Secondary/ISS01/Debrief03,Text,,"Zarya, the 'Dawn' module. Perfect name! Because now it’s the dawn of me having to manage even more paperwork. Thanks, Zarya."




Missions/Secondary/ISS02/Name,Text,,"ISS Mission 2: Unity"
Missions/Secondary/ISS02/Description,Text,,"We’re ready to take the next step in the construction of the ISS. Today, we’re launching Unity, the second module, and docking it with Zarya. Unity is a hub with multiple docking mechanisms where future modules will connect. We need to not only launch Unity into the correct orbit, but also perform a rendezvous and docking maneuver with Zarya. This requires careful planning, precise execution, and a healthy dose of Kerbal awesomeness."
Missions/Secondary/ISS02/Objective,Text,,"Dock Unity, along with PMA-1 and PMA-2, to Zarya, with no crew."

Missions/Secondary/ISS02/Debrief01,Text,,"Congratulations for a perfect rendezvous and docking, Director. It’s a beautiful sight to behold, Unity connected to Zarya."
Missions/Secondary/ISS02/Debrief02,Text,,"Now, with Unity in place, we’re ready to add more modules!"
Missions/Secondary/ISS02/Debrief03,Text,,"I just hope they remembered to label the docking ports. We wouldn’t want to accidentally attach the bathroom to the science lab."
