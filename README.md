# The ISS Construction Kit
_An ISS parts mod for Kerbal Space Program 2_

This mod seeks to provide ISS and space modeling enthusiasts with all of the station's components (eventually) so that they can recreate its construction in the historical sequence of assembly, or simply utilize them to construct the space station of their dreams.

### Zarya

Zarya, the original 'grandma' of the ISS, started out as the powerhouse, the brains, and the muscle of the station. But now, after years of hard work, she's basically the space version of an attic, filled with random stuff from the early days of space exploration.

### Unity

Unity is the first U.S.-built component of the ISS, linking the laboratory's Russian Orbital Segment and US Orbital Segment. Unity was launched on 4 December 1998, aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS-88.

### Zvezda

Zvezda provides essential life support systems and offers a cozy home for two lucky kerbonauts. But don't be fooled by its laid-back exterior - Zvezda can be remotely controlled, so if it ever decides to start slacking off, the KSC can give it a virtual kick in the pants.

### APAS-95 docking port

APAS-95 is an androgynous docking system used on the American and Russian modules on the ISS and to allow the Space Shuttle to dock.

### CBM docking port

It's the ISS's secret weapon for connecting habitable modules in the US Orbital Segment. It's like the ultimate "stick-it-to-the-man" (or, in this case, the space station) solution.

### PMA-1

PMA-1 is basically the space equivalent of a USB adapter, but instead of letting you connect your phone to a laptop, it lets spacecraft connect to the station. Think of it as the ultimate 'space plug-in' for cosmic commuters. Launched with the Unity module in 1998 aboard STS-88.

### PMA-2/3

This adapter is used on the ISS to convert a CBM interface to an APAS-95 docking port. PMA-2 was launched with the Unity module in 1998 aboard STS-88. It was outfitted special hardware to allow the shuttles to stay docked longer. PMA-3 was launched in 2000 aboard STS-92.

### Zvezda Solar Panel

Meet the solar panel that's seen more sunrises than a rooster. This retractable array is more interested in reminiscing about the glory days than tracking the sun. It's like a retired kerbonaut who's content to bask in the sunlight, occasionally muttering something about 'good old Comrade Sol'.

## Disclaimer
The CBM is used to connect habitable elements in the US Orbital Segment of the ISS. It is a non-androgynous system in reality but has been made this way in the game for simplicity.
## Known Issues
- RCS not included.
- Parts are not available on the tech tree.
- The Solar Panel is not self-tracking.
## Installation
Open the game folder by right-clicking on the game in your Steam library, selecting "Manage," and then clicking "Browse local files."
