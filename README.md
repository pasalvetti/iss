# The ISS Construction Kit
_An ISS parts mod for Kerbal Space Program 2_

> [!NOTE]
> This mod is in pre-release. It does not have all the ISS components yet.

This mod seeks to provide ISS and space modeling enthusiasts with all of the station's components (eventually) so that they can recreate its construction in the historical sequence of assembly, or simply use them to construct the space station of their dreams.

## Gallery
### Zarya

Zarya, the original 'grandma' of the ISS, started out as the powerhouse, the brains, and the muscle of the station. But now, after years of hard work, she's basically the space version of an attic, filled with random stuff from the early days of space exploration.

### Unity

Unity is the first U.S.-built component of the ISS, linking the laboratory's Russian Orbital Segment and US Orbital Segment. Unity was launched on 4 December 1998, aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS-88.

### Zvezda

Zvezda provides essential life support systems and offers a cozy home for two lucky kerbonauts. But don't be fooled by its laid-back exterior - Zvezda can be remotely controlled, so if it ever decides to start slacking off, the KSC can give it a virtual kick in the pants.

### Destiny

The Destiny module is the primary operating facility for US research payloads aboard the ISS. This is where science gets a little... spacey.

![Destiny icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_destiny_icon.png?raw=true)

### Canadarm2 (SSRMS)[^1]

The robotic arm moves equipment and supplies around the station, supports kerbonauts working in space, and services instruments and other payloads attached to the ISS. Though capable of delicate repairs and heavy lifting, it still can't figure out how to unclog the station's toilet.

![SSRMS icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_ssrms_icon.png?raw=true)

### Quest

Quest is the primary airlock for the ISS. It was designed to host spacewalks with both US and Russian space suits. The airlock was launched on STS-104 on July 14, 2001.

![Quest icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_quest_icon.png?raw=true)

### Z1 Truss

The Z1 truss is the ISS's master of orientation, the king of control. Itâ€™s like the captain of a ship, always making sure everyone is headed in the right direction. With its gyroscopes and plasma pals, it's got the station spinning and twirling like a top, ensuring it's always facing the sun just right.

![Z1 Truss icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_z1_truss_icon.png?raw=true)

### P6 Truss

The P6 truss was the second truss segment to be added (after the Z1 truss) because it contains a large Solar Array Wing (SAW) that generated essential electricity for the station. It was delivered by Space Shuttle Endeavour during STS-97. It was the last human spaceflight of the 20th century.

![P6 Truss icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_p6_truss_icon.png?raw=true)

### S0 Truss

The S0 truss forms the central backbone of the Space Station. It was attached on the top of the Destiny Module during STS-110 in April 2002. S0 is used to route power to the pressurized station modules and conduct heat away from the modules to the S1 and P1 Trusses.

![SO Truss icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_s0_truss_icon.png?raw=true)

### Solar Array Wing

The ISS Solar Array Wings are so powerful, they could probably light up the entire galaxy if they weren't busy powering the International Space Station to keep the lights on and the coffee brewing.

![SAW icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_saw_icon.png?raw=true)

### APAS-95 docking port

APAS-95 is an androgynous docking system used on the American and Russian modules on the ISS and to allow the Space Shuttle to dock.

![APAS-95 icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_apas-95_icon.png?raw=true)

### CBM docking port

It's the ISS's secret weapon for connecting habitable modules in the US Orbital Segment. It's like the ultimate "stick-it-to-the-man" (or, in this case, the space station) solution.

![CMB icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_cbm_icon.png?raw=true)

### PMA-1

PMA-1 is basically the space equivalent of a USB adapter, but instead of letting you connect your phone to a laptop, it lets spacecraft connect to the station. Think of it as the ultimate 'space plug-in' for cosmic commuters. Launched with the Unity module in 1998 aboard STS-88.

![PMA-1 icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_pma1_icon.png?raw=true)

### PMA-2/3

This adapter is used on the ISS to convert a CBM interface to an APAS-95 docking port. PMA-2 was launched with the Unity module in 1998 aboard STS-88. It was outfitted special hardware to allow the shuttles to stay docked longer. PMA-3 was launched in 2000 aboard STS-92.

![PMA-2/3 icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_pma23_icon.png?raw=true)

### Zvezda Solar Panel

Meet the solar panel that's seen more sunrises than a rooster. This retractable array is more interested in reminiscing about the glory days than tracking the sun. It's like a retired kerbonaut who's content to bask in the sunlight, occasionally muttering something about 'good old Comrade Sol'.

![Zvezda Solar Panel icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_zvezda_solar_panel_icon.png?raw=true)

### External Active Thermal Control System[^2]

The ISS's a busy place, and what happens when all that activity heats things up? The station's radiators come in, space's biggest heat dump! They collect heat and reject it by use of pumped liquid state ammonia in closed-loop circuits to cool the station.

![EATCS icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_eatcs_1x1_icon.png?raw=true)

### Module-to-Truss Structure Attach System

The MTSAS is a crucial, permanent component on the ISS that connects the S0 truss segment to the Destiny lab. This structure must withstand dynamic loads, pressure, and thermal cycles throughout the station's lifespan.

![MTSAS icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_mtsas_icon.png?raw=true)

### ISS Technical Docking Port

This is a hooking part to weld together two elements where kerbonauts are not intended to pass through, and thus where traditional docking ports should not be used. This component does not exist in the real ISS and have been added for gameplay. Not compatible with other docking ports.

![ITDP icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_itdp_icon.png?raw=true)

### Small ISS Technical Docking Port

This docking port is intended to join together small elements of the ISS, such as the Canadarm to the surface of a module.

![SITDP icon](https://github.com/pasalvetti/iss/blob/main/Icones/iss_sitdp_icon.png?raw=true)

## Assembly

For those daring enough to recreate the ISS's assembly in its historical sequence, this is the suggested procedure.

> [!TIP]
> In the absence of Canadarm, the use of tugs is necessary.

_(shuttle not included)_

## Disclaimers
This mod features a semi-realistic modeling of the ISS as some liberties were taken with reality in order to allow the parts to integrate properly with the game with reasonable performance.

For example the CBM, used to connect habitable elements in the US Orbital Segment of the ISS, is a non-androgynous system in reality but has been made androgynous in the game for simplicity.

This mod's author did his best to make every space shuttle assembly mission possible by allowing the elements to be stored in the stock mk3 cargo bay. Some elements may however still prove difficult to fit in, such as the P6 truss segment (you will need to tuck the radiators in).

## Known Issues
- RCS not included.
- Most parts are not paintable.
- Solar panels are not self-tracking.
- Solar panels deployments in the VAB are too slow.
- Zarya does not have its own solar panel yet (you can use Zvezda's).
- No reentry effects.
- Kerbals located inside Zvezda do not show on the interior view windows.
- Quest is not a functional airlock.

[^1]: Since KSP2 does not have robotics, this part is just for looks.
[^2]: You need to install [Meltdown](https://spacedock.info/mod/3822/Meltdown) to add heat management to the game and make it a functionnal radiator.
[^3]: Launchers are not included in this mod.
[^4]: Zarya solar panels to be included in a future release.
